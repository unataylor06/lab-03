# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?


Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?
The format `staff` is data *wide*

How many observations are there in the data set?

There are six observations in the data set


## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -faculty_type, 
    names_to = "staff_long",
    values_to = "percent"
  )

```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
print(
  ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = staff_long, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()
  )

```

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}
print(
  ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = staff_long, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()
  )



```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}
staff_long <- staff_long %>%
  mutate(staff_long = as.numeric(staff_long))

print(
  ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = staff_long, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()
  )



```

## Exercise 6

```{r better-line-plot}
print(
  ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = staff_long, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()+
  labs(
    title = "Percentage of employment in different year",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Percentage"))





```

## Exercise 7

_Write below your ideas for adapting the line plot_

* Change the year as a type of line, then change the x-axiz to the faculty 
* change the y-axiz label from percentage to a total number of people
*title the x-lable for better readbility




## Exercise 8

```{r implement-Ex7}
# Write your code for Exercise 8 here
print(
  ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = faculty_type, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = year)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  labs(
    title = "Number of employment in different year",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
)


```
